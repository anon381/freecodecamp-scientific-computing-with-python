# Python Mini-Projects

>This repository contains five Python projects demonstrating algorithms, simulations, and object-oriented programming. Each project is implemented as a standalone Python file and showcases practical problem-solving skills of mine.

## How I Earned the Certificate

This repository contains all the projects I completed for the freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Developer Certification. Each project demonstrates key concepts required for the certification, including algorithms, simulations, and object-oriented programming. Successfully building and submitting these projects earned me the certificate shown above, which also took nearly 300 Hours.

## 1. Arithmetic Formatter
*Formats arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side. Handles addition and subtraction only, with optional solution display.*

**Example:**
```
   32      3801
+ 698    -    2
-----    ------
```
**File:** `arithmetic_formatter.py`

---

## 2. Time Calculator
*Adds a duration to a start time in 12-hour format. Supports optional day of the week and multiple-day calculations.*

**Example:**
```
add_time('11:43 PM', '24:20', 'tuesday')
# Output: 12:03 AM, Thursday (2 days later)
```
**File:** `time_calculator.py`

## 3. Budget App
*Manages budget categories and transactions. Supports deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance checks. Generates a spend chart showing percentage spent per category.*

**Example:**
```
Percentage spent by category
100|          
 90|          
 80|          
 70|          
 60| o        
 50| o        
 40| o        
 30| o        
 20| o  o     
 10| o  o  o  
  0| o  o  o  
    ----------
     F  C  A  
     o  l  u  
     o  t  o  
     d  t  o  
```
**File:** `budget_app.py`

## 4. Polygon Area Calculator
*Implements Rectangle and Square classes using OOP. Computes area, perimeter, diagonal, and visual representation of shapes. Can determine how many times one shape fits inside another.*

**Example:**
```
Rectangle(width=10, height=5)
Square(side=4)
```
**File:** `polygon_area_calculator.py`

---

## 5. Probability Calculator (Hat Simulation)
*Simulates random draws of colored balls from a hat. Estimates probabilities for drawing specific combinations of balls.*

**Example:**
```
hat = Hat(blue=5, red=4, green=2)
experiment(hat, {'red':1,'green':2}, 4, 2000)
# Output: 0.356 (approx.)
```
**File:** `probability_calculator.py`
